# WS2-SWS-FIDDLES-SILEX - 11 - Session & Upload

Introduces the [SessionServiceProvider](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/providers/session.html) which is cleverly hooked on an other module using a [http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/middlewares.html#id1](before route middleware)

Also elaborates a tad further on [FormServiceProvider](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/providers/form.html) and [ValidatorServiceProvider](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/providers/validator.html) using a log and a upload form. Both forms use a customized HTML output (see the templates).
